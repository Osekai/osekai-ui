## how do i install?
it is recommended that you download the css file and use that, updating it as you want, as you'll need to change the css file to edit the theme colours.
you can download it from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osekai/osekai-ui/master/osekai-ui.css, just use CTRL + S.

## how do i use?
please read the wiki

## can i contribute?
yeah, please! - if you have any specific things you want to code into the css, make an issue for it and i'll supply designs, and how i think it would be laid out.
